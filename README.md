# Witchcraft

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern system based on Hyprland by running a single command. Witchcraft is built upon the solid foundation of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), inheriting its philosophy of providing a streamlined, opinionated, and highly functional Linux experience right out of the box.

Witchcraft aims to simplify the initial setup, removing the need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to keep up with the latest command-line utilities. It's an evolved take on what Linux can be at its best, with its roots in the efficiency and design principles of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).
